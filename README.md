# direst-need

A place to connect those in dire need such as the homeless with online donors.  Web GUI Mockup.

## Setup

One needs to place their Google Maps API Key in
~/.config/frdcsa/google_maps_apikey.txt, and then enable Google Maps
Javascript and Google Maps Geocoding for that key.  If the key has
restrictions, be sure to allow those two as well.
