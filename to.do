(USE CASES / USER STORIES:
 (Someone is passing by a homeless person who doesn't have a
  phone in great need.  They enter the information into the
  website and have the product shipped to them.)
 (Someone sees a homeless person in great need and enters them
  into direst-need, but allows others to make the purchases)
 (Someone feels charitable and browses online to find people
  who's situation they sympathize with and wish to donate to.
  They review stories and shopping lists.  They purchase a few
  items and have them shipped to the person.)
 )

(ISSUES:
 (what if donors spam the system with fake agreements for stuff
  that they don't intend to order)

 (what if recipients spam the system with fake requests for stuff
  that they don't intend to pick up)

 (what if recipients who have resources freeload by posing as
  homeless)

 (what if we text the homeless, notifying them of the orders to
  be expected, and what if people say they ordered but didn't, or
  the order falls through)

 (what if someone uses this to locate and attack someone,
  therefore, how do we address the fact that the buyer has to
  know what specific instructions to add to the delivery, to
  locate the homeless person.  Any way we can use an Amazon
  purchase API, or escrow or something.)

 (how do we ensure that there is sufficient knowledge to have a
  product correctly delivered.  i.e. does the homeless person
  know to stay in the same place.  what if the package is late?
  what if it never comes?  how do we confirm this to them?  What
  does amazon do with undelivered packages?)
